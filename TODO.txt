* all the todo:s.
* apologize for not having a ui toolkit.
* test gamepads.
* handle device pixel ratio.
* orientation hell, including effing manifest.json?
* wish i could hide the mouse cursor.
* add a game over sound.
* say sound(s) are loading when they are.
* ugly inconsistencies:
  * resizing things & left vs. right e.g. gPauseButtonCx.
  * events queue vs. immediate.
  * gDebug stuff is sort of super hacky all over the place.
  * i guess the Step() stuff is not sane.
* more bugs:
  * powerups sometimes getting stuck on spawn still.
  * music not always starting? permission? bad data?
  * somehow don't nuke player's game on rotation. :-(
  * crt bezier outline got worse the smaller the screen.
