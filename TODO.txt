* all the todo:s.
* dt step size!
* apologize for not having a ui toolkit.
* implement ProcessInput in all necessary states.
* mouse clicks, x, y for some things at least?
* test gamepads.
* handle device pixel ratio.
* orientation hell, including effing manifest.json?
* wish i could hide the mouse cursor.
* add a game over sound.
* resolve "any key" lies.
* ugly inconsistencies:
  * resizing things & left vs. right e.g. gPauseButtonCx.
  * events queue vs. immediate.
  * gDebug stuff is sort of super hacky all over the place.
  * i guess the Step() stuff is not sane.
* more bugs:
  * powerups sometimes getting stuck on spawn still.
  * music not always starting? permission? bad data?
  * don't nuke player's game on rotation.
  * crt outline gets worse the smaller the screen.
  * inputs still buffered sometimes badly e.g. game over exit.
  * oopsy player can move whle game is paused.
