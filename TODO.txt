* all the todo:s.
* apologize for not having a ui toolkit.
* test gamepads.
* handle device pixel ratio.
* orientation hell, including effing manifest.json?
* wish i could hide the mouse cursor.
* say sound(s) are loading when they are.
* wavy scaline fx.
* move A,B,SwapBuffers into reusableArray.
* play blip if puck collides and doesn't split.
* ugly inconsistencies:
  * resizing things & left vs. right e.g. gPauseButtonCx.
  * events queue vs. immediate.
  * gDebug stuff is sort of super hacky all over the place.
  * fix (w,h) -> (width,height) etc.
* more bugs:
  * wrong side chosen because not clearing input.
  * music not always starting? permission? bad data?
  * somehow don't nuke player's game on rotation. :-(
