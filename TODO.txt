* all the todo:s.
* deperately need to refactor so many globals away.
* globals horrible also because of no good input/event model.
* perf is worse in firefox vs. chrome/edge.
* actually profile but it just says "gc" so who knows what as root cause... need placement-new object pooling?
* test gamepads.
* handle device pixel ratio.
* orientation hell, including effing manifest.json?
* wish i could hide the mouse cursor.
* add wavy scalines?
* move A,B,SwapBuffers into reusableArray.
* play blip if puck collides and doesn't split.
* powerup pill timeout after say 10 seconds.
* super fugly inconsistencies:
  * clashing styles of events queue vs. immediate changes.
  * gDebug stuff is sort of super hacky all over the place.
  * the way powerups code is split up is ugly and confusing.
* more bugs:
  * wrong side chosen because not clearing input?!
  * music not always starting? permission? bad data?
  * music sometimes playing more than one simultaenously.
  * somehow don't nuke player's game on rotation. :-(
